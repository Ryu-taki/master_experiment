### Done
* first mtg
* environment setup
* Complete Exercise1
  * `experiment1.py`
  * output
    * `output/exercise1/four_compartments.png`
    * `output/exercise1/result.txt`

* Complete Exercise2
* Since Exercise2 uses the results from Exercise1, I need to modify `experiment1.py` to preserve the values of `i_values`.
